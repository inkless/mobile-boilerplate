# Frequently asked questions

### Should I use font-awesome.min.css file?

Whether to use such file is subject to your own choice. Please be noted that 
such mechanism is not compatible with US Browser which does't support font-family 
at all. You should properly evaluate the environment before you give a try. The 
path of the file has been adjusted for convenience. Feel free to use directly 
without hacking.

This is for you own choice. If you want to use this mechanism, just try it.
One thing I have to mention is that, this mechanism doesn't work in UC Browser
which does't support font-family at all. So think twice before you want to use
the font-awesome css. Note, I have help you adjust the path of the file, feel 
free to use it directly without hacking.

### Why use Zepto as the default library?

Zepto is a minimalist JavaScript library for modern browsers with a largely 
jQuery-compatible API. Since there are common features between Zepto and 
jQuery, there would be no difficulties for a experienced jQuery user to get 
started. With simple and familiar APIs, I enjoy and recommend to use Zepto.js - 
you may concentrate more on getting your stuff done.

### Do I need to upgrade my sites each time a new version of Mobile Boilerplate is released?

No. You don't normally replace the foundations of a house once it has been
built. There is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes
but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.
