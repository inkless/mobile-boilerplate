# Frequently asked questions

### Why is there a font-awesome css file?

This is for you own choice. If you want to use this mechanism, just try it.
One thing I have to mention is that, this mechanism doesn't work in UC Browser
which does't support font family at all. So think twice before you want to use
the font-awesome css. Note, I have help you adjust the path of the file, feel 
free to use it directly without hacking.

### Why using Zepto as the default library?

Zepto is a minimalist JavaScript library for modern browsers with a largely 
jQuery-compatible API. If you use jQuery, you already know how to use Zepto.
In my practice, I enjoy using Zepto.js and recommend you to do so. It's really
simple and familiar, so you may concentrate more on getting your stuff done.

### Do I need to upgrade my sites each time a new version of Mobile Boilerplate is released?

No. You don't normally replace the foundations of a house once it has been
built. There is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest changes
but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.
